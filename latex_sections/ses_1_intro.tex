\section*{Introduction}

In the first practical session, an investigation was made into two types of transmission lines: wave guides and coaxial cables. The waves guides were analysed in the frequency domain, and the voltage-standing-wave ration (VSWR) was determined for different loads, or terminations. The coaxial cables were measured in the time domain, placing emphasis on reflections and propagation speeds, which are effected by the type of load and cable parameters.
